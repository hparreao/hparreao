## Hi there 👋

I'm Hugo Parreão.

Currently studying for a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence Engineering, in parallel to my Bachelor’s Degree, through a Dual Degree Program. In addition, I am enhancing my experience in several areas, including Gen AI, LLMOps/AIOps, Software Engineering, Multi-agent Systems, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Software Quality, Data Science and Machine/Deep Learning, through online teaching platforms such as DeepLearning.AI, Coursera, Alura and Udemy.

I am motivated by my passion for new technologies and participating in innovative projects. I am adept at planning, organizing and working with data to inform decisions and solve problems, always maintaining a commitment to responsible and ethical AI in data. Experience in projects using Deep Learning, AI, NLP and Multi-Agent Systems.

I'm also interested in art and entertainment media, such as games, movies, TV shows, music, comics and other elements of geek culture.
